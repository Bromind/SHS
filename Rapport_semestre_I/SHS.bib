	abstract = {Venture capitalists ({VCs}) fund ventures with the aim of reaping a capital gain upon exit. Research has identified information asymmetry between inside investors and follow-on investors as a major source of friction. It is thus in the interest of {VCs} to reduce information asymmetry at exit. Matthias Eckermann analyzes how {VCs} integrate information efficiency considerations into their exit strategies. He shows that {VCs} adopt specific strategies to cope with information gaps upon exit in terms of timing, exit vehicles and promotion efforts. On this basis he develops a framework to help {VCs} to improve profitability through decisive exit strategies.},
